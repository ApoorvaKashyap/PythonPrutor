The PRL course had a total of 6 Labs, out of which only the best 5 were considered for evaluation. The various labs along with the topics they covered are listed below.
The platform for evaluation was [Prutor](https://py.prutor.com/), developed in IIT, Kanpur in 2015. It has some visible test cases and some hidden ones, against which it tests your output.

A. Advantages of Prutor:
  1. Automated Evaluation

B. Disadvantages of Prutor: 
  1. Not Mobile-Friendly.
  2. Has issues accepting code that is pasted from other IDEs.
  3. Hidden Test Cases are really irritating. :P
